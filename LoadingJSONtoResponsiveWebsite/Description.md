# LoadingJSONtoResponsiveWebsite
## How to Run: 
To Run this example you need to run it on a server. To run it locally I am using the [Live Server VSC extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/). Once installed just right-click on the index.html file and select ``` Open with Live Server ``` option. I used Chrome to see the page.

## Contents
In this example I am making an AJAX call to load a JSON file, containig an array of hotel rooms information, from the local server. When the user clicks a button a function gets called to display more information about the hotel room the user clikced on.

## What I learned: 
- I learned that you can first call the server to load the JSON and then you can call a function to load differenrt parts of the JSON depending on different user events, like clicking of a button.
