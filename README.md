# Working_With_JSON
**Description:**
I created this repo to test and learn more about working with JSON data.
I created 4 folders with different tutorials I followed and different 
things I added/tested in each.

---
## Folders:

| Folder Name | Description  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [startJS](startJS/Description.md) | Displays nested JSON objects in console and webpage |
| [loadingExternalJSONData](loadingExternalJSONData/Description.md)| Uses AJAX call to load JSON file from local server and prints XMLHttpRequest Object Properties and the object itself onto the console |
| [loadArrayJSON](loadArrayJSON/Description.md) | Uses AJAX call to load JSON file from local server and displays U.S. President and Vice-Presidents onto webpage |
| [LoadingJSONtoResponsiveWebsite](LoadingJSONtoResponsiveWebsite/Description.md) | Uses AJAX calls to load and display JSON data onto responsive webpage when the user clicks on any of the 3 top buttons |
| [weatherAPIAppUsingJSON](weatherAPIAppUsingJSON/Description.md)| Uses AJAX calls to communicate with UnderGrond Weather API to populate weather data onto responsive webpage base on zipcode user inputs. Since the API owners decided to discontinue the free API service, I had to mock the data onto 2 JSON files |
