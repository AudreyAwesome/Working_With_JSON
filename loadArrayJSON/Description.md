# loadArrayJSON
## How to Run: 
To Run this example you need to run it on a server. To run it locally I am using the [Live Server VSC extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/). Once installed just right-click on the index.html file and select ``` Open with Live Server ``` option. I used Chrome to see the page.

## Contents
In this example I am using an AJAX call to load a JSON file, which contains 2 arrays with the names of 3 US Presidents and their serving terms as well as their respective Vice-Presidents,  from the local server and print it first to the console and then onto the webpage.

## What I learned: 
- I learned that AJAX lets you update parts of a webpage wihtout needing to reload the whole page by exchaning data with a server behind the scenes.
- How to iterate over a JSON object that contains arrays.
